This websit is a stepup from the first website I built, this one will include flex, and flexbox to arrange a lot of complex elements around the landing page. I do hope to deepen my understanding of flex and how to arrange flex elements around each other. 
My journey so far has been a blast and I hope to learn a lot more in the days to come.
